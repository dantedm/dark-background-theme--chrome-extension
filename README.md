# Dark Theme Everywhere

**_Darkens bright pages for easier nighttime reading.

**Before:**

![thenews.im with its regular theme](./before.png)

**After:**

![thenews.im with a dark theme applied](./after.png)

Improvements from _Nicer Inverter_:
 - Dark-ifies pages aggressively, so you're much less likely to come across pages with bright patches.
 - Dark-ifies pages _by default_, so you don't need to click the extension's button on every page load.
 - Allows you to toggle dark styles on and off without reloading the page.
 - Black text now mods to navy instead of yellow

You can change the default theme from "Dark" to "Light" by going to Tools -> Extensions and clicking the "Options" link under Dark Theme Everywhere. You can toggle the theme with a hotkey by going to Tools -> Extensions and clicking the "Keyboard shortcuts" link at the bottom.

_Enjoy!_
